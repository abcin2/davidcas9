I'm David, I'm an independent neuroscience researcher and software developer interested in education technology, synaptic plasticity, memory traces, and learning and memory circuitry in general.

 ### Exploring TMS Mechanisms With High-res Imaging

* Dr. Lipeng Ning at the MGH Camprodon lab has developed high resolution diffusion MRI techniques and has been using them to study mechanisms of neuromodulation. As a prospective incoming data analyst for the lab, I hope to elucidate these mechanisms by leaning on novel statistical techniques validated by various researchers including Rajan, Jadi, and Harvey.

### Plasticker

* Few models have allowed for the simulation of synaptic plasticity in a biophysically realistic manner. I am augmenting large realistic network models built with Michael Hinesâ€™ NEURON library to produce these kinds of constrained models to elucidate the role of plasticity in learning and memory circuits involving the hippocampus.

### CORnet Radiology

* The MIT DiCarlo labâ€™s CORnet is the highest performing visual cortex model to date. Iâ€™m working on testing whether it performs more similarly to layperson accuracy, expert accu- racy, or traditional ML accuracy on radiology image data.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

I'm learning about neural coding models, dynamical modeling in Julia, and how to use NEURON and Nengo.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

* Student modeling approaches incoporating neurally realistic networks and features like stress, pharmacology, and emotional/motivational processes.

* Realistic modeling of corticothalamic circuitry involved in memory and learning.

Send me a github message. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: 

If you do kareoke before your exam, you will probably do much better on it, especially if you were nervous.
