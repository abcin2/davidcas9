I'm David, I'm an independent neuroscience researcher and software developer interested in education technology, synaptic plasticity, memory traces, and learning and memory circuitry in general.

 ### Exploring TMS Mechanisms With High-res Imaging

* Dr. Lipeng Ning at the MGH Camprodon lab has [developed high-resolution diffusion MRI techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811915009738) and has been using them to study mechanisms of neuromodulation techniques like repetitive [transcranial magnetic stimulation](https://www.britannica.com/science/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation) (rTMS). As a prospective incoming data analyst for the lab, I hope to elucidate these mechanisms by leaning on novel statistical techniques validated by various researchers including Rajan, Jadi, and Harvey.

### Plasticker

* Few models have allowed for the simulation of synaptic plasticity in a biophysically realistic manner. I am augmenting large realistic network models built with Michael Hinesâ€™ [NEURON library](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) to produce these kinds of constrained models to elucidate the role of plasticity in learning and memory circuits involving the hippocampus.

### SPAUN Mods

* Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a platform ([SPAUN](https://xchoo.github.io/spaun2.0/)) within Nengo that allows users to plug in and out models of different cognitive systems in the brain to see how they interact to form behaviors (through the control of a robotic arm). The MIT DiCarlo labâ€™s CORnet is the highest performing visual cortex model to date. I am looking to implement CORnet and other highly successful and realistic neural system models in SPAUN 2.0, then benchmark them using [BrainScore](http://www.brain-score.org/) on layperson and expert recognition tasks.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

I'm learning about neural coding models, dynamical modeling in Julia, and how to use NEURON and Nengo.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

* Student modeling approaches incoporating neurally realistic networks and features like stress, pharmacology, and emotional/motivational processes.

* Realistic modeling of corticothalamic circuitry involved in memory and learning.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

Math! Let me know if ya know of a good resource for probability and advanced differential equations.

Open an issue on this repo with a way to reach you.

âš¡ Fun fact: 

If you do kareoke before your exam, you will probably do much better on it, especially if you were nervous.
