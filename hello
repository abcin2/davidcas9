Hello David!

I saw your job posting on AngelList and I was so excited about the company, I wanted to find a way to contact you! (I have already submitted an application)
I have been in education for 4 years and am looking to make a career change to software engineering, but hadn't really considered the possibilty of still involving myself in education.
My developing experience includes:
  - finishing fullstack certification via freeCodeCamp.com
  - developing and deploying various full stack mobile and web apps using various frameworks such as ReactJS and Django
  - starting and continuing development of my photography website: alechoveyphotography.com
  
Best way to contact me is either via phone (text or call) --> 508-317-7871
or email: robert.hovey95@gmail.com
  
I look forward to hearing from you and hope to be in contact soon!

Robert (Alec) Hovey
